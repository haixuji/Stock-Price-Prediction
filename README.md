Introduction
------------
This is a stock market forecasting model, implement the linear regression model, Random Forest, GBTs and LSTM (*Long Short Term Memory*) models to compare the final prediction performance. The ‘lr_model’ folder saves the best model, the ‘ml_test_data.csv’ saves the test data for demo.

This model is designed to make it easy to answer many of the questions people have during stock investment:

* Dose stock historical data have reference value for future trendency?
* How could pyspark used for the price prediction?
* Which algorithm can we use for stock prediction?
* How do the different models we used performed?

Data visualization
-----

Execute

```
$ jupyter notebook
```

then it will go to jupyter norbook homepage automatically

The input data for the model is 'AAPL.csv'

The imput file path needs to be defined first

Linear Regression Model
-----------

  * the demo code is at the bottom of the notebook
  * the model path and data path need to be define in advance
  * go through the code line by line the results will be shown

LSTM Model
-----------

  * the demo code is at the bottom of the notebook
  * the model path and data path need to be define in advance
  * go through the code line by line the results will be shown


Requirements to Build
---------------------

  * Anaconda
